# Loan Default Prediction Model

## Problem Statement
To build a predictive model based on whether the applicant would default or fully pay back the loan. The target variable 'outcome' indicates whether the loan has been paid off
or defaulted. Hence, it is a binary classification problem. The dataset contains 78 columns and 41,029 rows of data, each one representing information on a funded loan.

Business Application: Companies, especially finanial institutions, can increase their profit margins when a model can find creditworthy consumers whilst lowering their default risk. 
I will apply a range of machine learning models to be able to try and achieve this. Logistic Regression as well as tree-based models such as Random Forest will be applied.
